        <div class="entry-content poem">
            <p>The first bruise bloomed on my neck,<br>
            your lips spelling out a claim<br>
            in the quiet heat of our closeness.<br>
            It wasn’t just skin you touched—<br>
            it was the part of me that opens<br>
            only when trust is heavier than fear.</p>

            <p>Since then,<br>
            you’ve painted me again,<br>
            and again—<br>
            your mouth a brush of hunger,<br>
            your hands anchoring me<br>
            to the world we build in whispers and gasps.</p>

            <p>I have learned that loving you<br>
            is not just sweetness—<br>
            it’s the wild, unshaken rhythm<br>
            of wanting and being wanted.<br>
            It’s the way your eyes blaze,<br>
            and how my pulse forgets itself</p>

            <p>when you’re riled and unafraid.<br>
            I let you see all of me,<br>
            even the shameless parts,<br>
            because you’ve shown me<br>
            how safety can be raw and breathless.</p>

            <p>And every mark you leave<br>
            is a quiet promise—<br>
            that this fire between us<br>
            will not dim,<br>
            only deepen.</p>
