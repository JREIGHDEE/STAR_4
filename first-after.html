        <div class="entry-content poem">
            <p>The first time,<br>
            I led.<br>
            Not to claim, not to own,<br>
            but to show you the fire in me<br>
            and the way it bends toward you.</p>

            <p>I wanted you stirred,<br>
            to see yourself<br>
            the way I do...strong, unshaken,<br>
            capable of making the world kneel.</p>

            <p>And you did.</p>

            <p>After that,<br>
            you began to lead.<br>
            Your touch spoke in a language<br>
            I never wanted to stop hearing.<br>
            You carried a quiet certainty,</p>

            <p>and I followed,<br>
            not out of surrender,<br>
            but because I wanted to learn<br>
            every way you could love me.</p>

            <p>Now each time,<br>
            I promise you something new.<br>
            A different way to pull you closer,<br>
            a different way to make you feel<br>
            how much of myself Iâ€™ve placed in your hands.</p>

            <p>It is not a contest<br>
            of who holds more power.<br>
            It is a dance<br>
            where each step<br>
            is a gift we take turns giving.</p>

            <p>And I will keep surprising you,<br>
            not just to keep the fire alive,<br>
            but because loving you<br>
            means never running out of ways<br>
            to make you know<br>
            you are worth every moment.</p>
